### 4. **Calculate GPA and get AI guidance**
###### About
This tool allows students to track progress by calculating their gpa/cgpa based on both 4.0 and 5.0 system, together with AI recommendation on how to get their grades up.
It is divided into two sections:
* New: This helps to compute GPA for a single semester
* Old: This helps to calulculate cummulative GPA (CGPA) for all completed semesters using previous CGPA and number of units previously done.
###### Use case
Calculating CGPA before a new semester considering each of the new courses to be done, to be able to set minimum grade for each course, depending on a target goal. I have personally tried this in school and it helped all the time.

###### Future additions
Allow upload of result documents (pdf) or image (screenshot) to calculate CGPA.

###### Sample
